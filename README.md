# Advent of Code 2020

Playing with Haskell is fun. Hopefully, I'll get better at it eventually.

## Usage

- Download the daily input you want to use.
- Load `app/Main.hs` in ghci (`stack repl` should do it automatically).
- Run solver, e.g. `apply day1 "day1.txt"` (`dayXX` for the first part, `dayXX'` for the second).
